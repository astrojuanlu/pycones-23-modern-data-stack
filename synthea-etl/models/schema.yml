  - name: cost
    description: The COST table captures records containing the cost of any medical event recorded in one of the OMOP clinical event tables such as DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, VISIT_OCCURRENCE, VISIT_DETAIL, DEVICE_OCCURRENCE, OBSERVATION or MEASUREMENT.  Each record in the cost table account for the amount of money transacted for the clinical event. So, the COST table may be used to represent both receivables (charges) and payments (paid), each transaction type represented by its COST_CONCEPT_ID. The COST_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID field will use concepts in the Standardized Vocabularies to designate the source (provenance) of the cost data. A reference to the health plan information in the PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table is stored in the record for information used for the adjudication system to determine the persons benefit for the clinical event.

  - name: condition_era
    description: "A Condition Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to have a given condition. Similar to Drug Eras, Condition Eras are chronological periods of Condition Occurrence.
    Combining individual Condition Occurrences into a single Condition Era serves two purposes:
    * It allows aggregation of chronic conditions that require frequent ongoing care, instead of treating each Condition Occurrence as an independent event.
    * It allows aggregation of multiple, closely timed doctor visits for the same Condition to avoid double-counting the Condition Occurrences.
    For example, consider a Person who visits her Primary Care Physician (PCP) and who is referred to a specialist. At a later time, the Person visits the specialist, who confirms the PCP''s original diagnosis and provides the appropriate treatment to resolve the condition.
    These two independent doctor visits should be aggregated into one Condition Era."
